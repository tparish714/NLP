 Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree strengthening the defenses of  the only bridge  connecting annexed Crimea to the Russian mainland after a huge blast early Saturday severely damaged its structure. 
 
 
 Russian leaders said the blast, which killed three people, was caused by a truck blowing up on the road bridge. Ukrainian officials have publicly  celebrated the explosion , without directly claiming responsibility.  
 At least 12 people were killed and 87 others wounded after rockets struck the Ukrainian city of  Zaporizhzhia  on Saturday, according to officials. 
 The last power line connecting the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to Ukraine’s power grid was damaged and disconnected Saturday  due to shelling by Russian forces , according to Ukraine’s nuclear operator.

      More than 200 rescuers are on scene at the site where a  round of missile strikes  killed at least 12 people and injured scores in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, authorities said Sunday.
   
 
      “As of 15:00 [3:00 p.m. local time], emergency rescue operations at the sites of missile strikes in Zaporizhzhia continue. In total 215 people and 58 vehicles are involved (including 85 people and 20 vehicles from the State Emergency Service), as well as 8 teams (8 search dogs) of the dog unit ‘Antares’ from Pavlohrad town,” Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said in a tweet.
   
 
 Earlier today : The  southern city was hit  by six Russian cruise missiles and 16 S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, according to Ukraine’s air force. The cruise missiles were fired from Russian Tu-22M3 and Su-35 fighter jets inside Russian-held areas of the Zaporizhzhia region.

      CCTV video appears to show the moment a large  explosion heavily damaged the Kerch bridge  that links Russia’s mainland with annexed Crimea, in a devastating blow to Vladimir Putin’s war effort in Ukraine. 
   
 
      “A truck is seen driving in the lane towards Crimea when all of a sudden there’s a massive explosion, though it’s not clear whether it is the truck that actually blew up,” CNN’s Fred Pleitgen reports.
   
 
      Russian leaders said the blast, which killed three people, was caused by a truck exploding on the road bridge. Ukrainian officials have publicly  celebrated the explosion , without directly claiming responsibility.

      Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu said Saturday’s  explosion on Kerch Bridge  is a “win” for Ukraine “whatever the reason behind the blast,” a foreign ministry press officer told CNN Sunday. 
   
 
      The blast left the road and rail bridge linking annexed Crimea to mainland Russia severely damaged, which Ukraine has celebrated but not claimed responsibility for.
   
 
	“Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu has stated that the blast on Kerch bridge has an important symbolic, moral and military-tactical value for Ukraine as it hampers Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine by cutting down its military supply chain via Crimea,” the press officer told CNN.
 
 
      “Whatever the reason behind the blast, it’s a win for the Ukrainian Armed Forces nonetheless.”

      Another train has passed over the Kerch Bridge, traveling from Sevastopol to St. Petersburg, following the blast that severely damaged parts of the road and rail bridge between annexed Crimea and the Russian mainland, Russian state media TASS reported on Sunday.
   
 
      The first passenger services resumed travel across the bridge on Saturday, traveling from the Crimean peninsula to Krasnodar Krai in southern Russia, Russia’s Ministry of Transport said in a statement.
   
 
      Some road traffic has also resumed, according to the Russian-appointed deputy leader of Ukraine’s occupied Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, who said on Sunday that “there is no threat of interruptions in food supplies to the Kherson region due to the rapid resumption of traffic on the Crimean bridge.”
   
 
      However, heavy trucks, vans and buses are traveling on ferry boats.
   
 
      About 100 vans and trucks and about 650 passengers have been ferried across the Kerch Strait since the blast, TASS reported on Sunday, citing Crimean authorities. Ferries for both light vehicles and heavy trucks have already made several journeys overnight and on Sunday.
   
 
      TASS also reported that a line of about 200 cars has formed in Krasnodar, Russia, from where the ferry to Crimea departs. Passenger buses are also departing via ferry and are able to bypass the lines.
   
 
 Repair works:  On Saturday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin said repair works on the bridge would be carried out around the clock. He added that a damage survey will be completed within a day and Russian divers will check all the supports of the bridge on Sunday morning.

 Local official: 87 civilians, including 10 kids, were wounded by Zaporizhzhia missile strikes

      At least 87 civilians, including 10 children, were injured by a round of missile strikes on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, Oleksandr Starukh, head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said Sunday.
   
 
      Officials had earlier said that 49 people were injured in the strikes.
   
 
      The southern city was hit by six Russian cruise missiles and 16 S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, according to Ukraine’s air force. The cruise missiles were fired from Russian Tu-22M3 and Su-35 fighter jets inside Russian-held areas of the Zaporizhzhia region.

 Ukrainian troops are outside key Luhansk town Svatove, regional official says

      Ukrainian troops are preparing for further advances into Russian-held Luhansk, according to Serhiy Hayday, head of the Luhansk region’s Ukrainian military administration.
   
 
      Hayday acknowledged photographs of Ukrainian troops outside the Luhansk village of Stelmakhivka, less than 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the crucial post of Svatove.
   
 
 
 
    We have everything ready – medicines, humanitarian kits, and repair kits. Everything is ready. We just want to come in and talk with people, to help them restore their lives,” Hayday said.
   
 
 
 
 
      New Ukrainian incursions into Luhansk have been made possible by the rapid-fire reclamation of territory in the past weeks, particularly the re-taking of Lyman in the Donetsk region.
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
      All of Luhansk region is claimed as Russian territory by the Kremlin,  following its forcible annexation . But in recent days Ukrainian forces have been approaching the region from several directions, building on their successful offenses in Kharkiv and Donetsk.

      A round of missile strikes on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed 12 and left 49 injured early Sunday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine.
   
 
      Zaporizhzhia official Anatoliy Kurtev had earlier said 17 were killed with 40 injured.
   
 
 What happened?  The southern city was hit by six Russian cruise missiles and 16 S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, according to Ukraine’s air force.
   
 
      The cruise missiles were fired from Russian Tu-22M3 and Su-35 fighter jets inside Russian-held areas of Zaporizhzhia region.
   
 
      Russia has repurposed S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to hit ground targets, hitting civilian infrastructure and residential neighborhoods in Zaporizhzhia early Sunday.
   
 
      Meanwhile on Sunday, Ukraine’s southern command claimed to have shot down a Russian jet fighter in the Mykolaiv region as well as an Iranian-made drone close to Odesa.

 Here's the latest on the Crimea bridge explosion  
 
 
 
 
 
 
      Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree strengthening the defenses of  the only bridge  connecting annexed Crimea to the Russian mainland after a huge blast early Saturday severely damaged its structure.
   
 
      Here’s what led up to this:
   
 
 The blast:  A huge explosion severely damaged  the only bridge  connecting annexed Crimea to the Russian mainland, causing parts of Europe’s longest bridge to collapse. At least three people were  were killed , according to Russian officials.
   
 
 Ukrainian leaders celebrate:  While stopping short of claiming responsibility, high-ranking Ukrainian officials publicly celebrated the bridge explosion. Ukraine’s secretary of the National Security and Defense Council posted a  taunting birthday message for Putin  and the  postal service announced stamps  commemorating the blast. In Kyiv, residents  posed for selfies  in front of a billboard depicting the burning bridge.
   
 
 The damage:  Maxar satellite images captured the damage to the Kerch Strait bridge Saturday, shortly after an  explosion rocked  the only direct road and rail connection between annexed Crimea and mainland Russia.
   
 
      The blast caused parts of the bridge to collapse, though Russian transportation officials  restarted rail service  and allowed vehicles to use some undamaged portions of the roadway by Saturday evening.
   
 
 Some travel across the bridge restored:  Russian officials rushed to investigate the explosion and restore partial service on the bridge’s parallel rail and roadway structures. By evening,  limited car traffic resumed  on undamaged parts of the bridge and  train service had restarted . The blast disrupted major transport links, however, and Russian officials planned to use ferries for trucks.
   
 
 Repair work to begin:  On Saturday, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin said the lights on the Crimea bridge were set to be restored in the next few hours so that repair works could be carried out around the clock.
   
 
      Khusnullin added that divers would start work on Sunday to check all the supports of the bridge. Once all results are received, a decision will be made to open traffic on the bridge for buses and heavy vehicles.

      Thirty-five of the 40 people hospitalized after a deadly rocket attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia Saturday night are in a stable condition, according to a local official.
   
 
      Two children are among those hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries while a further 12 are receiving outpatient treatment according to Anatoly Kurtev, acting mayor of the city. 
   
 
      In a Telegram post Sunday morning Kurtev warned people in Zaporizhzhia to go to air raid shelters immediately.
   
 
 Scores killed:  At least 17 people were killed and 40 others wounded after rockets struck Zaporizhzhia on Saturday, according to the city’s Acting Mayor Anatoly Kurtev.
   
 
      The attack, which began around 7 p.m. local time, destroyed five houses and damaged apartment buildings and streets, Kurtev said Saturday on his official Telegram channel.
   
 
 Some context:  Zaporizhzhia is a major city in southern Ukraine, not far from the front line, and the site of a nuclear power plant that the international community is  watching warily .
   
 
      Part of the wider region is occupied by Russian forces. 
   
 
      Russian President Vladimir Putin signed measures this week to  annex four Ukrainian regions , including Zaporizhzhia, in violation of international law.

 Russian draft dodgers pour into Kazakhstan to escape Putin's war

      Vadim says he plunged into depression last month after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military draft to send hundreds of thousands of conscripts to fight in Ukraine.
   
 
      “I was silent,” the 28-year-old engineer says, explaining that he simply stopped talking while at work. “I was angry and afraid.”
   
 
      When  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  began in February, Vadim says he took to the streets of Moscow to protest — but Putin’s September 21 order to draft at least 300,000 men to fight felt like a point of no return.
   
 
 
 
    “We don’t want this war,” Vadim says. “We can’t change something in our country, though we have tried.”
   
 
 
 
 
      He decided he had only one option left. Several days after  Putin’s draft orde r, he bid his grandmother a tearful farewell and left his home in Moscow — potentially forever.
   
 
      Vadim and his friend Alexei traveled as fast as they could to Russia’s border with the former Soviet republic of  Kazakhstan , where they waited in line for three days to cross.
   
 
      “We ran away from  Russia  because we want to live,” Alexei says. “We are afraid that we can be sent to Ukraine.”
   
 
      Both men asked not to be identified, to protect loved ones left behind in Russia.
   
 
      Last week, in Kazakhstan’s commercial capital Almaty, they stood in line with more than 150 other recently-arrived Russians outside a government registration center — part of an exodus of draft dodgers.
   
 
 Voting with their feet:  More than 200,000 Russians have streamed into Kazakhstan following  Putin’s conscription announcement , according to the Kazakh government.
   
 
      And it isn’t hard to spot the new Russian arrivals at the main railway station in Almaty. Every hour, it seems, young Slavic men emerge from the train wearing backpacks, looking slightly dazed while consulting their phones for directions.
   
 
      They arrive from cities across Russia: Yaroslavl, Togliati, St. Petersburg, Kazan. When asked why they have left they all say the same thing: mobilization.
   
 
      “It’s not something I want to participate in,” says a 30-year old computer programmer named Sergei. He sat on a bench outside the train station with his wife, Irina. The couple, clutching backpacks and rolled up sleeping pads, said they hoped to travel on to Turkey and hopefully apply for Schengen visas to Europe.

      Fierce battles are taking place around the strategic city of Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Saturday.
   
 
 
 
    “We are holding positions in Donbas, in particular in the Bakhmut direction, where now it is very, very hard, very tough fighting,” Zelensky said. 
   
 
 
 
 
      “Today, I would like to once again mention our soldiers from the Kholodny Yar 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade for their courage and sustained power in this direction.” 
   
 
      Zelensky also said one of the highest priorities for Ukraine right now is “to speed up the decision of our partners to provide Ukraine with modern and effective anti-aircraft systems in sufficient quantity.” 
   
 
      On Saturday, Germany announced more weapon deliveries for Ukraine, including the IRIS-T air defense system, and a total of 100 tanks from Greece and Slovakia.

 UN nuclear watchdog condemns renewed shelling that knocked Zaporizhzhia plant off power grid

      The UN’s nuclear watchdog condemned new shelling near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which just disconnected the plant from Ukraine’s power grid, according to its operator.
   
 
      The resumed shelling is “tremendously irresponsible,” International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said Saturday in a  press release. 
 
 
      The last power line connecting the plant to Ukraine’s power grid  was damaged and disconnected Saturday  due to attacks by Russian forces, according to the Ukrainian nuclear operator Energoatom. The plant is now relying on diesel generators.
   
 
      “The resumption of shelling, hitting the plant’s sole source of external power, is tremendously irresponsible. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant must be protected,” Grossi said on Saturday. 
   
 
	“All the plant’s safety systems continue to receive power and are operating normally, the IAEA experts were informed by senior Ukrainian operating staff at the site,” he added in the release.
 
 
      “Although the six reactors are in cold shutdown, they still require electricity for vital nuclear safety and security functions. The plant’s diesel generators each have sufficient fuel for at least ten days. ZNPP engineers have begun work to repair the damaged 750 kV power line,” according to the release.
   
 
      Grossi stressed that the plant “must be protected” and added that he will “soon travel to the Russian Federation, and then return to Ukraine, to agree on a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant. This is an absolute and urgent imperative.”
   
 
 What Russian officials say:  The plant can be put back into operation, said Vladimir Rogov, who is a senior pro-Russian official in the regional Zaporizhzhia government. 
   
 
      “Now the nuclear power plant has been switched back to the emergency mode of operation. The last power line that connected it with the right bank, with the territories controlled by [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky’s regime, has been cut. For now, the nuclear power plant can only be powered by diesel generators, and this is an unusual means,” Rogov said while speaking to the pro-Kremlin “Soloviev Live” show on Saturday. 
   
 
      “We have every possibility to restore the nuclear power plant and put it into operation,” he added.

      The  Crimean bridge explosion  accelerates the strategic choices Russian President Vladimir Putin must make about Russia’s occupation of southern Ukraine.
   
 
      This entire presence was already poorly supplied, managed and in retreat. Rickety ferry crossings in bad weather or highly dangerous air cargo flights may now be needed to bolster military shipments into Crimea and toward the frontlines. 
   
 
      Ukraine has been targeting Russia’ aging transport dependencies — particularly its reliance on rail — with slow, patient accuracy. First  Izium , which led to the collapse around  Kharkiv . Then Lyman, which is leading to the erosion of Russia’s control of Donetsk and Luhansk. And now the Kerch Strait bridge, which had become so vital to everything that Russia is trying to hold on to in the south.
   
 
	Putin now faces a series of expedited and painful decisions, all of which will severely belie his continued poker-face of pride and bombast toward the gathering signs of slow defeat.
 
 
      To the west of the Dnieper river, his army in Kherson is besieged by fast-moving Ukrainian forces. Putin’s troops are already in retreat, partially owing to the same poor resupply that will be accentuated by the Kerch blast.
   
 
      They are again cut off from this faltering supply line by another series of damaged or targeted bridges across the Dnieper. Over the past week, they have already fallen back over 500 square kilometers (about 193 square miles). 
   
 
      Can Moscow sustain this force over two damaged supply routes? A precarious presence has perhaps overnight become near-impossible. 
   
 
      The second point of decision relates to  Crimea . Putin now faces the difficult choice of fortifying it further with depleted forces who face resupply issues, or partially withdrawing his military to ensure their significant resources on the peninsula do not get cut off.
   
 
      Putin must choose between feeding his larger ambitions with a dwindling chance of success or consolidating forces around an objective he has a greater chance of achieving.
   
 
      One carries the risk of catastrophic collapse, for his entire brutal adventure into Ukraine — and quite possibly, his rule. The second leaves him with an immediate loss of face, but a stronger chance of sustaining the occupation of smaller parts of Ukraine.
