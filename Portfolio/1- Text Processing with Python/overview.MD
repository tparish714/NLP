## About the Program
This program reads an input file (data.csv) and then performs text normalization. 
Columns in the data.csv file include last name, first name, middle initial, id, and office phone. 
To run the program, you must have the data.csv in the same directory. The libraries used in this program include:
```
import sys
import pathlib
import re
import pickle
```



## Strengths of Python for Text Processing
Python, in my opinion, is a good text processing tool because it has several powerful libraries, including NLTK. 
We can easily perform word tokenization and sentence tokenization with NLTK.


## What I Learned
In this assignment, I reviewed some data structures, such as lists and dictionaries, as well as how to create a simple class. 
In addition, I learnt how to use regular expressions (regex) for text processing and pickle files to serialize Python object structures.
